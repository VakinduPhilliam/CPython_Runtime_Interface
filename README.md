# CPython_Runtime_Interface
Python C/C++ Runtime API.

The Application Programmerâ€™s Interface to Python gives C and C++ programmers access to the Python interpreter at a variety of levels.

There are two fundamentally different reasons for using the Python/C API.

The first reason is to write extension modules for specific purposes; these are C modules that extend the Python interpreter. 

This is probably the most common use.  The second reason is to use Python as a component in a larger application; this technique is generally referred to as embedding Python in an application.
